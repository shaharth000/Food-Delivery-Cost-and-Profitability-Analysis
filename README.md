# Food-Delivery-Cost-and-Profitability-Analysis

In this project, Python is utilized to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a food orders dataset. The analysis identifies loss-making situations and uncovers key insights that impact profitability. Based on these findings, new pricing strategies are proposed to help the business enhance its profitability. The project aims to provide actionable recommendations that can drive better decision-making and financial outcomes.
